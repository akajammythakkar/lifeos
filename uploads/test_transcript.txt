[00:00] Alice: Alright team, let's get started. First on the agenda is the website redesign. We need to finalize the homepage layout.

[00:10] Bob: I can take that up. I’ll share a draft by Friday.

[00:18] Alice: Great, thanks Bob. Next, the marketing team wants us to create a demo video for the product launch.

[00:26] Charlie: Yeah, I think I can help with that. Maybe have a first version ready by next Wednesday?

[00:34] Alice: That works. Please coordinate with Maya on the script.

[00:40] Maya: Got it, I’ll send Charlie the initial script outline by tomorrow.

[00:45] Alice: Awesome. One last thing – we need a Q2 hiring plan draft ready before the leadership review next week.

[00:54] Bob: I’ll loop in HR and put something together by Tuesday.

[01:00] Alice: Perfect. That’s it, folks. Thanks!
